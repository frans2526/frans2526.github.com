  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bonjour !<br>
I&#8217;m in Montreal since one big month but I didn&#8217;t have the time to write some post.
So the big good news is I got a job in <a href="http://www.equationhumaine.co/" title="Equation Humaine">Equation Humaine</a> as a web developer. It&#8217;s an really amazing place with a lot of space and great people. <br>
I found also a roommate in a nice place in Montreal, the people are friendly and it&#8217;s nice because most of the people who live in the building are also student or young professional.<br>
We had a snow storm this week and so I saw one of the things that I wanted to see in Canada, a lot of snow :-D
But that was the last time this season, I think because now the temparture goes more in the positif.</p>

<p>The last weekend with two of my co-workers we went to the office to watch the first Formula 1 GP. At 11PM to 4AM and that was a little bit crazy but that was a really good moment. We had six screens with the two on the left the stats, on the middle top the weather on the bottom the live and on the rigth somes twitter feeds.</p>

<p>About the city, I think is more an &#8220;European&#8221; city and I can buy a lot of EU brand that I couldn&#8217;t find in Van. The building are also more cachet than in Van and the city is smaller than Toronto so I prefere that. The public transport is really good, there are a lot of metro station every where and the price is cheaper than in Van 91$ vs 77$ in Montreal.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for today ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello and welcome in the cold!<br>
I&#8217;m in Toronto in my friend house, and outside it&#8217;s freezing, it&#8217;s -20C, that change from Vancouver with 6C&#8230;<br>
But I like that and I&#8217;m really happy to be here. My friend is a hockey referee so we went to an arena.
He had to work and I went with him to watch the three games, even if he said that wouldn&#8217;t be good games, one of them was good and the two others was OK.</p>

<p>The next day we went to London, ON because he had a lesson there and he show me the university of London who are really amazing (I saw the university under the sun) that can modify my objectivity but that was a awesome to see this kind of university. It&#8217;s totally different from the university in Belgium.</p>

<p>After all the trip, we stop in an lovely restaurant, the kind of restaurant that you can see in the border of the road in the US movie and I ate a delicious burger, I think the best of my life :-D<br>
After that, we went to his compatibility class, that wasn&#8217;t really interristing for me. <br>
And when we had finished to work, we went to Waterloo, ON because it&#8217;s the city of RIM, no I&#8217;m just kiding it&#8217;s not for this reason, we went there to met one of his friend. That was really stunning because I was in Canada, speaking with two canadien english.<br>
I think this day is one of my favourite day of my trip even if that don&#8217;t look really interesting.</p>

<p>Today I receive two apoitment in Montreal so I&#8217;ll move so there and try to get a job&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After less than four months in Vancouver, I have to say goodbye to all my new friends that I met during my trip in Van. It&#8217;s really difficult for me to do that because I met so many amazing people here but I want to move somewhere else.<br>
Somewhere, where I can see some snow and not all this rain everyday&#8230; (I&#8217;m in Canada not in Belgium :-D) <br> So I decide to go first in Toronto to see a canadian friend but before I had to do my farewell party in the Pint :-p
This name will be unforgettable for all my life.</p>

<p>After I want to go in Montreal or Quebec but I don&#8217;t know yet&#8230; I like to speak in english and the english culture but I think that will be easier for me to find a job in Quebec where I can speak french.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t keep only a good memorie of Van, this reason was my job in Wishpond, after only one month, I had already a bad impression of this place. My co-workers was funny and genial but the direction was totaly awfull and disrespectful.<br>
We was at least between 40 and 45 persons in a small office, I had the habit to say to my colleague that we was in &#8220;Auschwitz&#8221;.
Imagine to work in a subway, it&#8217;s the same but that was not the worst, they wanted always more &#8220;money&#8221; (for the Belgium people see the Luminis ads) and also I learn nothing except maybe &#8220;how you don&#8217;t have to manage a company&#8221; :-D<br>
Just for remind you they didn&#8217;t pay us for the work that we did there&#8230;</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s the past lets go Toronto!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s already 3 months I&#8217;m in Vancouver! That start to be long but I have a lot of work so I didn&#8217;t see all the time I spend here :-)
I find a job in <a href="http://corp.wishpond.com">Wishpond</a> where I&#8217;m Web Developer.<br>
When I arrived in October there was only 15 people and now I think we arrive at least 35 person! It&#8217;s like my second family, we hang out every week to the WhiteSpot and it&#8217;s always a good time there :-)</p>

<p>What&#8217;s append between my last post and now?<br>
A lot of party and hours of work :-p but except that some of my best left Vancouver to go back on there country so I&#8217;m sad for that and also because it&#8217;s the first time for me I will don&#8217;t pass chrismas with my family.
The last Sunday I went to the Chrismas Parade with some friends that was really great and it&#8217;s really tipical to see all the people parading in the street, it&#8217;s like in the american movie. (I post some pictures at the end of the post)<br></p>

<p>Yesterday I went to Deep Cove because I never been there and also that was a beautiful day, so we were walking in the forest
to the view point where we can see Deep Cove and in the back Vancouver. We saw also the snow on the top of the mountain that&#8217;s great because it&#8217;s something that I miss, it&#8217;s the cold and the snow especially because the temperature here it&#8217;s between 7C and 4C daily with rain the sunset it&#8217;s at 4:00pm and the sunrise at 7:20am.</p>

<p>Chrismas is there !<br>
Here the Chrismas is everywhere and also earlier than in Belgium after Halloween it&#8217;s directly Christmas&#8230; Buisness is Buisness.
My boss will organise a Christmas diner the next sunday for the company like in the american movie :-p</p>

<p>See you later and don&#8217;t hesitate to write a comment,</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi guys !</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay but I was really busy :-p
I continue where I stopped so my first day of school I met some people but especially two who now are good friends Marie and Adam. Marie comes from Belgium and Adam comes from Barcelona.
I don&#8217;t remember all the activity we did but one of my typical day in Tamwood was when I finished the school at 1:50pm Adam and I we visited some places of Vancouver with the sunshine :-p
I leaved my first homestay after 3 weeks because I had extended for two more weeks in Tamwood so they didn&#8217;t keep me more longer so now I&#8217;m in a homesaty with two italian retired people, the homestay mum kook very well, she kooks every days pasta.</p>

<p>After 4 weeks there I needed to say goodbye of this amazing place and I started a marketing intership at Wishpond, it&#8217;s a startup in the downtown of Vancouver and for the moment I working there.
I found an apartment with Adam in Vancouver but not in the downtown, it&#8217;s a quite place near from the public transports(+-20 min to the downtown).
And because when I don&#8217;t know what I can say I will talk about the weather :-D so here in Vancouver, all the month of September was incredible hot and sunny but now the weather change to &#8220;Raincouver&#8221; and the temperature is decrease each day. This weekend they starting to snow in Alberta, in the north and the east of the British Columbia.</p>

<p>The Next week we will celebrate Halloween and maybe we will go to a haunted house.</p>

<p>See you later and don&#8217;t hesitate to write a comment,</p>

<p>Bye</p>

<p>NB: it&#8217;s time for me to watching the Walking Dead on AMC :-D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello,
I leave Brussels the 5 september to Vancouver for one year. The flight to Montreal was good and when I arrived and passed the border. I went to the immigration office and a men ask me with enthusiasm &#8220;Pourquoi venez au Canada aujourd&#8217;hui ?&#8221;. I was really suprise but in the good way of course. After I toke my Work &amp; Holiday Visa and my second fligth.
I sleept all the fligth to Vancouver so that was pretty cool when I arrived in Vancouver I was really tired yes it&#8217;s true guys :-p so I sleept all the night ;-)</p>

<p>The day after I received all my documents from the agency and I toke my Social Insurance Number for working in Canada.
After I had gone to my first homestay but unfortunately I missed my homestay mum in the station so I walked between the Nanaimo station and my homestay. When I arrived there, there had nobody so I waited during 20 minutes outisde before they came back from a soccer game :-D but that was a sunny day so that was not really a big problem.
My room was huge with a TV and the familly is really friendly. In the family there are the mum Kathie, the french father Patrick and they&#8217;re 3 kids Nik, Julian and Stefan. There is also an other student from Brazil Jaime. Everybody is so friendly, it&#8217;s awesome !</p>

<p>After I had been to a swimming pool with Jaime, Stefan and Stefan friends. That was really cool because I had talked with Jaime and we went to the steam and in the hot tub.
The weekend finished, I went to the school &#8220;Tamwood Internationnal&#8221; when I met a lot of new friends from all around the world but especially Brazil, Japon and Spain (Catalogna(for you gyus :-D)). I think it&#8217;s really great to meet ohter people and know the new culture.</p>
